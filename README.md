# KPI
This python script automatically updates a message board with values from Plex using automation, not an API (Unfortunately).
KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator.

Versions of python and installed modules:
- python 3.7.8
- PyAutoGUI 0.9.52
- selenium 3.141.0
- ChromeDriver 80.0.3987.106
- Visual Studio 16.8.3
- numpy 1.19.3 (Do not update to 1.19.4! It was recently discovered that this version doesn't pass a "sanity check", thus it'll raise an error in the program)

Requirements:
- Plex login for Wanco
- The correct .ini file (example found in this repository)
- Ethernet cable connection to an active message board

Abbreviations:
Message Board window = MBw
Plex window = Pw

There are three phases to this script: Setup, Update, Restart.
Setup will happen first, and then Update will happen.
Restart is only entered if an unhandled error occurs in the Setup or Update phase. After the Restart phase, the Setup and Update phase will occur as normal.

Update 11/23/2020: I'm waiting on test Plex credentials so I can take my own out.

Update 12/4/2020: I now have generic Plex credentials.

Update 12/18/2020: Back to my credentials since the generic account got nerfed in terms of what pages it can access. There are 
plans for this program to be used soon. However, there's been issues with getting the board to work on 3x4 panels instead
of the 3x5 I've been working with.

Update 12/22/2020: Although the program interacts with the MBw every minute, the former occassionally asks the user
roughly every half hour to sign back in with the admin/administrator credentials. In this case, a person will have
to type in the credentials. I'm assuming that failing to do so before the next update will prompt a timeout error
and the program will restart. Even though this restart would "fix" everything, all inactivity progress would be lost.
In addition, deploying a program that will raise an error every half hour doesn't sound good.

Update 12/23/2020: It seems that the alert is so special that when it shows up, the program stops at its current line
and freezes up. This has prevented many solutions such as alert_is_present, action chains, and pyautogui. I did find
one exception to this though. Triggering a login prompt via selenium will result in the program freezing up and 
rendering the rest of the execution null. However, triggering a login prompt via manual mouse clicks doesn't freeze
the program, allowing for pyautogui to log in again. The program updates the board every minute; now, it also logs
out and logs back in between those minutes to refresh activity.

Update 12/29/2020: An updated copy of the original program has been fully adapted for a 3x4 board. This new program
also requires the use of an updated .ini file. In addition, I'm thinking about changing the text color to blue or
white if the line meets its quota. This way, the text won't turn red despite the quota being met.

Update 12/30/2020: When a line has a quota and has met it, the text color will turn blue. This signals that a line
has achieved their target amount and prevents the text from turning red out of inactivity. Speaking of inactivity, 
there's an idea of pausing a line when they're on break. The only thing that'd happen for sure during a break is
the line's inactivity counter ceasing to increment. During this time, I could also make the text color turn into
one of the two unused colors: amber and white. Or what if I change the total to say "On Break"? I think the latter
is a better idea since it conveys the message better and too many colors can get confusing. This project is gonna
take a physical form soon.

Update 1/8/2021: There a third python file in the repository called Plex2Board(WithBreak) that's based off of the
Plex2Board3x4 file. While the latter is a program to print information from Plex to a message board, Plex2Board(WithBreak)
is that with a feature to stop the inactivity counter for separate lines when they go on break. The break times 
for lines are a new section of the .ini file.

Setup Phase:
The script will attempt to locate chromedriver.exe on the computer. Once found, it'll use chromedriver.exe's path and selenium to create 
two webdrivers, driver and remote, that will utilize google chrome. Main() is called while driver and remote are being passed, too.
configparser is used to read the contents of an .ini file, which is in the same directory as the script, into a variable: config.
setup_board() is called with driver and setup_plex() is called with remote. setup_board() uses driver to open a chrome window with the
software to operate the message board. MBw requires login credentials; however, the credentials are entered into an embedded part of the
page. This means selenium cannot reach it, but PyAutoGUI can. Though, the thing about PyAutoGUI is that it's manual automation.
PyAutoGUI will take control of the mouse and it will only interact with windows on the front layer. What this means is that
if the MBw isn't the front most window, the script will attempt to enter the credentials in the wrong location. setup_plex() uses remote
to open a chrome window to operate Plex. The script will navigate to the Production History page on Plex. Finally, the program will
create a new message on the MBw that consist of the current time, line name, and how many trailers they have dropped (out of a quota
if applicable). There will be one "face" for each line specified in the .ini file. 

Update Phase:
In this phase, the program will stay in the function, update_board(), until completion. The board message and its faces will update
every minute due to the time display. Every minute, not only will the program update the current time, it'll also look at each line's
Production History information to check if the amount of trailers dropped increased. In addition, the program keeps track of the amount
of time a line has spent "idle". In the .ini file, each line has an "inactivity" value. Every time the board gets updated and a line's
trailer amount hasn't increased, a separate counter increments. When this counter equals the line's inactivity value, that line's
face text turns red. When the line's trailer amount increases, counter is reset to zero and the text turns back to green. It is
possible for one line's text to be green and another line's text to be red because the message board cycles through faces. In addition,
text will turn blue if a line's quota has been met. Once blue, the text can't change to another color. The program will stop when the 
current time equals the overtime closing time: 4:30 pm. At this point, the program will clear the board, bring MBw back to the main menu, 
and quit both drivers. Before inactivity is incremented for a line, the program will check if the line is on break or not. If not,
inactivity is incremented. If they're on break, inactivity is stalled. The other service this check provides is toggling breaks when
the current time matches one in the .ini file.

Restart Phase:
This phase only occurs if an error prohibits the script's progress. Every function in the program is called, one way or another, through
main(). This means that any error that occurs will result in the brief exit out of main(). Thus, the call to main() is placed inside
a try block. Should an error (that's uncovered by other try/except blocks inside other functions) happen, main's try block skips
all remaining inner statements and enters the except block. This block simply prints a message stating the program is restarting. Next,
the finally block will quit both drivers to close the windows and free up space in memory. The try/excpet/finally blocks are all in a
while loop. The program will always restart unless the try block fully executes all of its statements; this includes the last statement,
the one that sets the conditions to break the while loop.

3x5 board: 3 rows, 5 light panels in a row, 8 character limit per row with current font (05x07 Fixed Spacing)

3x4 board: 3 rows, 4 light panels in a row, possible 6 character limit per row given that one character is 5 bulbs wides with the current font (05x07 Fixed Spacing)
The only font that would increase the character limit per row is 04x05 Prop Spacing. The downside is that the 05 makes the text much smaller than the 07. This means,
the text might be difficult to see from a distance.
