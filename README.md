# KPI
This python script automatically updates a message board with values from Plex using automation, not an API (Unfortunately).
KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator.

Versions of python and installed modules:
- python 3.7.8
- PyAutoGUI 0.9.52
- selenium 3.141.0
- ChromeDriver 80.0.3987.106
- Visual Studio 16.7.6

Requirements:
- Plex login for Wanco
- The correct .ini file (example found in this repository)
- Ethernet cable connection to an active message board

Abbreviations:
Message Board window = MBw
Plex window = Pw

There are three phases to this script: Setup, Update, Restart.
Setup will happen first, and then Update will happen.
Restart is only entered if an unhandled error occurs in the Setup or Update phase. After the Restart phase, the Setup and Update phase will occur as normal.

Setup:
The script will attempt to locate chromedriver.exe on the computer. Once found, it'll use chromedriver.exe's path and selenium to create 
two webdrivers, driver and remote, that will utilize google chrome. Main() is called while driver and remote are being passed, too.
configparser is used to read the contents of an .ini file, which is in the same directory as the script, into a variable: config.
setup_board() is called with driver and setup_plex() is called with remote. setup_board() uses driver to open a chrome window with the
software to operate the message board. MBw requires login credentials; however, the credentials are entered into an embedded part of the
page. This means selenium cannot reach it, but PyAutoGUI can. Though, the thing about PyAutoGUI is that it's manual automation.
PyAutoGUI will take control of the mouse and it will only interact with windows on the front layer. What this means is that
if the MBw isn't the front most window, the script will attempt to enter the credentials in the wrong location. setup_plex() uses remote
to open a chrome window to operate Plex. The script will navigate to the Production History page on Plex. Finally, the program will
create a new message on the MBw that consist of the current time, line name, and how many trailers they have dropped (out of a quota
if applicable). There will be one "face" for each line specified in the .ini file. 

Update:
In this phase, the program will stay in the function, update_board(), until completion. The board message and its faces will update
every minute due to the time display. Every minute, not only will the program update the current time, it'll also look at each line's
Production History information to check if the amount of trailers dropped increased. In addition, the program keeps track of the amount
of time a line has spent "idle". In the .ini file, each line has an "inactivity" value. Every time the board gets updated and a line's
trailer amount hasn't increased, a separate counter increments. When this counter equals the line's inactivity value, that line's
face text turns red. When the line's trailer amount increases, counter is reset to zero and the text turns back to green. It is
possible for one line's text to be green and another line's text to be red because the message board cycles through faces. The 
program will stop when the current time equals the overtime closing time: 4:30 pm. At this point, the program will clear the board,
bring MBw back to the main menu, and quit both drivers.

Restart:
This phase only occurs if an error prohibits the script's progress. Every function in the program is called, one way or another, through
main(). This means that any error that occurs will result in the brief exit out of main(). Thus, the call to main() is placed inside
a try block. Should an error (that's uncovered by other try/except blocks inside other functions) happen, main's try block skips
all remaining inner statements and enters the except block. This block simply prints a message stating the program is restarting. Next,
the finally block will quit both drivers to close the windows and free up space in memory. The try/excpet/finally blocks are all in a
while loop. The program will always restart unless the try block fully executes all of its statements; this includes the last statement,
the one that sets the conditions to break the while loop.

This program's goal has yet to be physically implemented. Even then, I imagine I'll have to revisit the code to fix bugs.
